# Gitlens - Extension for VS Code
[Gitlens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) - shows Github activity in VS Code
This extension helps to better manage your repository and commit history, branches etc inside VS Code.

# Github repository visualization
# Sourcetree

So far I've found the user interface to work well with Sourcetree, here's the project as of this commit:

Gitlens has a paid extension for VS Code that allows for repo visual view inside the pane where the command line is.
When I first grasped Git (re: that "Aha!" moment) - I used Sourcetree on one monitor and VS Code in the other. 
Watching the changes show up in real time, uncommited files, what it looked like when branches changed seem to help me understand how Git worked.

Gitlens has a visual interface for VS Code, but it is a paid feature, so that's why I am using [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).
Also because it is built by Atlassan which is a front-runner in the SDLC SaaS industry.


# Better Git prompts

On the command-line, improve the look of your prompt when in a Git repository.
If you set this up in your standard terminal (shell), it will transfer to VS Code or another IDE.
