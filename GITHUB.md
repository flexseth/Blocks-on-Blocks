So far I've found the user interface to work well with Sourcetree, here's the project as of this commit

[Download Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

When I first grasped Git (re: that "Aha!" moment) - I used Sourcetree on one monitor and VS Code in the other. 
Watching the changes show up in real time, uncommited files, what it looked like when branches changed seem to help me understand how Git worked.
I also used Sourcetree to switch branches to add ideas for new blocks, update documentation, etc. It helped to have both windows open.

Gitlens has a visual interface for VS Code, but it is a paid feature, so that's why I am using 
Also because it is built by Atlassan which is a front-runner in the SDLC SaaS industry.
