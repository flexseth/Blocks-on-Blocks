# Blocks on Blocks
Lots of blocks to develop. Made to demonstrate how to do WordPress development with Git. Some workflow stuff included here and there.

This README file is made to link to the various projects and to provide direction on how to compile and work on the projects. This is meant to be a collaborative effort and expertise into distributed work, using Git, and doing cutting-edge stuff with WordPress.


### Configuration for Github (Collaboration)
*TODO* Build out info pages

Story Block (from WordPress.com)
https://wordpress.com/support/wordpress-editor/blocks/story-block/
- Creating a similar block using InnerBlocks and the Cover block

Could make it a Snapchat style story, with a custom editable (or pulls from page title) heading. Make the heading draggable and the photo refocus able as a background.. swipe to make it go away or drag from top down to close it. 
- Todo: Upload golf story from Facebook as an example
- Discuss: Is this available in Jetpack?
- Possible use case for Block Variations
- Looks like AMP
